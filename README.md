## Description
I wanted to practice vanilla JavaScript ES6 and recall Promise API, so I decided to code a search engine with a pseudo server. \
The idea is as follows:
1) Your write something in a search line
2) The server returns you all users that have input value in their names
3) The app shows you cards with user data that contain avatar, name and id.

## Quick Start
The project is created on vanilla JS ES6, HTML and CSS. No additional technologies are required to run the project. Clone and have fun.
